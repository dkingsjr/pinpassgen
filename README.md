# pinpassgen
This is a Pin/Password generator coded in Python.
Within this repository, you will see the source code as well as a .exe file that can be used on Microsoft Windows WITHOUT installing Python.
If you wish to make edits to the code, I welcome these edits so long as you contact me before you make the edits and run them by me.
